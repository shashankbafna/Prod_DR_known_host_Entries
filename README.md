### Script Description: `generate_known_hosts_entry.sh`

This Bash script facilitates the generation of `known_hosts` entries for SSH connections based on provided CNAMEs (Canonical Names) and resolves their associated IP addresses. It ensures that the `known_hosts` file remains organized and effective for secure SSH connections by grouping entries based on IP addresses.

### Features:

1. **Dynamic Input Handling**:
   - Accepts a variable number of CNAMEs as arguments (`<cname1> <cname2> ... <cnamen>`).

2. **Public Key Retrieval**:
   - Automatically retrieves the public key (`id_rsa.pub`) from the current user's `~/.ssh` directory and encodes it in Base64.

3. **IP Resolution**:
   - Uses DNS resolution (`dig +short`) to fetch IP addresses associated with each provided CNAME.

4. **IP Grouping**:
   - Groups `known_hosts` entries by IP address to prevent duplicates and ensure efficient management.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Provides error messages and skips entries if any CNAME fails to resolve to an IP address.

6. **Test Case Integration**:
   - Includes a built-in test case to validate the generated `known_hosts` entries against expected formats.

### How to Run:

1. **Save the Script**:
   - Save the script as `generate_known_hosts_entry.sh` in your preferred directory.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Ensure the script has executable permissions:
     ```sh
     chmod +x generate_known_hosts_entry.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script with the following format:
     ```sh
     ./generate_known_hosts_entry.sh <cnameA> <cnameB> ...
     ```
     Replace `<cnameA>`, `<cnameB>`, etc., with the actual CNAMEs you want to use.

### How to Test:

1. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the script with a set of CNAMEs to generate `known_hosts` entries:
     ```sh
     ./generate_known_hosts_entry.sh a-alias.example.com b-alias1.example.com b-alias2.example.com
     ```

2. **Verify Output**:
   - Check the output to ensure that each `known_hosts` entry is correctly formatted, including the IP addresses and public key.

3. **Validate with Test Case**:
   - Observe the test case output within the script execution, which explicitly states if each generated `known_hosts` entry passes validation.

4. **Final Verification**:
   - Ensure the script concludes with "All tests passed!" indicating that all entries are correctly formatted and validated.

### Example Output:

If `b-alias1.example.com` resolves to `192.168.1.2` and `b-alias2.example.com` resolves to `192.168.1.3`, the script would generate and validate entries such as:
```
a-alias.example.com,b-alias1.example.com 192.168.1.2 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAsamplekey...encoded...in...Base64...
a-alias.example.com,b-alias2.example.com 192.168.1.3 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAsamplekey...encoded...in...Base64...
--- Test Case ---
Test passed for IP: 192.168.1.2
Test passed for IP: 192.168.1.3
All tests passed!
```

### Summary:

This script automates the generation of `known_hosts` entries, ensuring secure SSH connections by managing entries based on CNAMEs and their resolved IP addresses. It offers flexibility with variable inputs, robust error handling, and built-in validation to maintain the integrity of SSH configurations.
